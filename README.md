# about alien character 
Kali used alien character in its root terminal. 
It used alien character instead @ in its root terminal, root@kali# 
But, latest versions, Kali doesn't include that character. 
I like alien character. So, i made & shared this scripts for whom who wants to use the alien. 
This script can help you. 

#First, download the script & change into executable file with the following command
``` 
chmod +x alienKali.sh 
```
 
 
 After giving permission, you can install it.
 
 ```
 sudo   ./alienKali.sh 
 ```
 
 
 After installing, you can see your root alien character in your root terminal.
 
``` 
sudo  su 
```
 
 Thanks
